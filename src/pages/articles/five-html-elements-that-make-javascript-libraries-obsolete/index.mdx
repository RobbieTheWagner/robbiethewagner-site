## Do we even need JavaScript anymore?

With the slew of hot new HTML functionality, the answer may be no!

## &lt;details&gt; and &lt;summary&gt;

Accordions have been a popular feature of web apps for decades. They have
historically been bundled with very heavy JS and CSS to animate the opening and
closing of the accordion and added a lot of bloat to an application's bundle
size. With the introduction of the `<details>` and `<summary>` elements,
everyone can now have a simple accordion without the need for any additional
JavaScript.

```html accordion.html
<details>
  <summary>
    <span>What's the best fast food?</span>
  </summary>
  <strong>Taco Bell</strong>
</details>
```

<details>
  <summary>
    <span>What's the best fast food?</span>
  </summary>
  <strong>Taco Bell</strong>
</details>

If you are not concerned with animating the opening/closing or changing the
default styles, you are done. However, if you want things to look a little more
polished, you can apply some small styling changes to make opening and closing
buttery smooth.

```css smooth-accordion.css
details {
  padding-top: 16px;
  padding-bottom: 16px;
}

details summary {
  cursor: pointer;
  margin-bottom: -16px; /* for more prominent move */
  transition: margin 150ms ease-out;
}

details[open] summary {
  margin-bottom: 16px;
}
```

<details className="group py-4">
  <summary className="-mb-4 cursor-pointer transition-all group-open:mb-4">
    <span>What's the best fast food?</span>
  </summary>
  <strong>Taco Bell</strong>
</details>

## &lt;progress&gt;

In the past, you may have used libraries like progress.js to create progress
bars for your applications, but not anymore! Thanks to HTML's `<progress>`
element, these libraries are now mostly obsolete.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```html progress.html
<progress value="750" max="1000">
  <span>70</span>%
</progress>
```

<progress value="750" max="1000">
  <span>70</span>%
</progress>

## &lt;meter&gt;

`<meter>` is very similar to `<progress>` but has a subtly different meaning. It
should be used when you want to display a scalar measurement within a range, for
example, disk usage.

```html meter.html
<div>
  <label for="disk_c">Disk usage C:</label>
  <meter id="disk_c" value="2" min="0" max="10">2 out of 10</meter>
</div>
```

<div>
  <label htmlFor="disk_c">Disk usage C:</label>
  <meter className="ml-2" id="disk_c" value="2" min="0" max="10">
    2 out of 10
  </meter>
</div>

## &lt;dialog&gt;

Modals and such

## &lt;input&gt;

### &lt;input type="color"&gt;

```html color-input.html
<input type="color" />
```

<label className="flex items-center">
  Pick a color
  <input className="ml-2" type="color" />
</label>

### &lt;input type="date"&gt;

## Wrapping up

Hopefully this has enlightened some of you to the power of native HTML solutions
and will make you think twice about reaching for a library by default.
