## Do we even need JavaScript anymore?

Of course we do, but maybe not as often as you would think! With the slew of hot
new HTML functionality, I am increasingly finding that native HTML elements do
many of the same things I used to reach for JavaScript libraries for. Come with
me on this journey and we'll explore my top 5 HTML elements that replace bloated
JavaScript libraries.

## &lt;details&gt; and &lt;summary&gt;

Accordions have been a popular feature of web apps for decades. They have
historically been bundled with very heavy JS and CSS to animate the opening and
closing of the accordion and added a lot of bloat to an application's bundle
size. With the introduction of the `<details>` and `<summary>` elements,
everyone can now have a simple accordion without the need for any additional
JavaScript.

```html accordion.html
<details>
  <summary>
    <span>What's the best fast food?</span>
  </summary>
  <strong>Taco Bell</strong>
</details>
```

<details>
  <summary>
    <span>What's the best fast food?</span>
  </summary>
  <strong>Taco Bell</strong>
</details>

If you are not concerned with animating the opening/closing or changing the
default styles, you are done. However, if you want things to look a little more
polished, you can apply some small styling changes to make opening and closing
buttery smooth.

```css smooth-accordion.css
details {
  padding-top: 16px;
  padding-bottom: 16px;
}

details summary {
  cursor: pointer;
  margin-bottom: -16px;
  transition-property: all;
  transition-duration: 150ms;
  transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
}

details[open] summary {
  margin-bottom: 16px;
}
```

<details className="group py-4">
  <summary className="-mb-4 cursor-pointer transition-all group-open:mb-4">
    <span>What's the best fast food?</span>
  </summary>
  <strong>Taco Bell</strong>
</details>

## &lt;progress&gt;

In the past, you may have used libraries like progress.js to create progress
bars for your applications, but not anymore! Thanks to HTML's `<progress>`
element, these libraries are now mostly obsolete.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```html progress.html
<progress value="750" max="1000">
  <span>75</span>%
</progress>
```

<div className="flex items-center">
  <progress
    className="progress-unfilled:bg-[#F2F2F2] progress-filled:bg-cyan-700"
    value="750"
    max="1000"
  >
    <span>75</span>%
  </progress>
  <span className="ml-2">75</span>%
</div>

## &lt;meter&gt;

`<meter>` is very similar to `<progress>` but has a subtly different meaning. It
should be used when you want to display a scalar measurement within a range, for
example, disk usage.

```html meter.html
<div>
  <label for="disk_c">Disk usage:</label>
  <meter id="disk_c" value="2" min="0" max="10">2 out of 10</meter>
</div>
```

<div>
  <label htmlFor="disk_c">Disk usage:</label>
  <meter className="ml-2" id="disk_c" value="2" min="0" max="10">
    2 out of 10
  </meter>
</div>

## &lt;dialog&gt;

Modal dialogs are a very common thing in JavaScript applications. There are
countless libraries for rendering the modal,

```html modal-dialog.html
<dialog>
  <button autofocus>Close</button>
  <p>Hello, I am a modal dialog!</p>
</dialog>
<button>Show the dialog</button>
```

export const ModalDialog = () => {
const dialogRef = useRef();

function closeModal() { dialogRef.current.close(); }

function showModal() { dialogRef.current.showModal(); }

return (

<>
  <dialog
    className="fixed left-1/2 top-1/2 -ml-32 -mt-24 h-48 w-64 transform p-8"
    ref={dialogRef}
  >
    <button
      autoFocus
      className="rounded bg-slate-200 px-4 py-2 text-gray-900 transition-colors hover:bg-slate-400"
      onClick={closeModal}
    >
      Close
    </button>
    <p>Hello, I am a modal dialog!</p>
  </dialog>
  <button
    className="rounded bg-slate-200 px-4 py-2 text-gray-900 transition-colors hover:bg-slate-400"
    onClick={showModal}
  >
    Show the dialog
  </button>
</>
) }

<ModalDialog />

## &lt;input&gt;

There are a TON of
[input types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)
built into HTML these days that make collecting data from users a breeze. While
I could list many examples, I think there are two types that really stick out to
me as being able to replace complicated JavaScript libraries.

### &lt;input type="color"&gt;

The color input type is something I discovered at work while trying to fix a bug
in our custom color picker logic. We were using an outdated package, that had
not been maintained in years, and debugging it was proving very difficult.

While looking for alternatives, I happened to take a peek at the current input
types that existed, and I was overjoyed to find `type="color"` as it was exactly
what I needed!

```html color-input.html
<input type="color" />
```

<label className="flex items-center">
  Pick a color
  <input className="ml-2" type="color" />
</label>

### &lt;input type="date"&gt;

The date picker has plagued web developers since the dawn of web development
itself. We all know we will probably need one for our applications, but there
has never been a great one that handled all the necessary functionality, without
bugs, worked well on mobile, and was customizable to fit the look and feel of
our apps.

Enter the native HTML input `type="date"`. This thing is amazing. It handles all
the functionality you could ever want from a date picker, and since it is native
will seamlessly fall back to native controls on mobile.

Pretty much the only downside is, since they are browser specific, there isn't
much you can do to have a consistent look and feel across browsers. I would
argue this shouldn't be a big deal though. Users are used to input controls
matching the environment they are browsing in, so if they don't match your
application, I think that is okay.

```html date-input.html
<input type="date" />
```

<input type="date" />

## Wrapping up

Hopefully this has enlightened you to the power of native HTML solutions and
will make you think twice about reaching for a library by default. What are some
of your favorite HTML elements? Hit me up on Twitter and let me know!
