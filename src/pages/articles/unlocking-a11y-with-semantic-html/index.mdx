## Is learning HTML actually important?

Y üëè E üëè S üëè! Too many people jump right into learning React these days
without understanding the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It can be
tempting to skip the "easy" stuff and just learn it on the job, but you are
setting yourself up for failure. Using HTML incorrectly can lead to severe
accessibility issues and poor user experience. Let's explore some examples and
learn how to craft better semantic HTML.

## UI Controls

### Can you tell the difference between these two input/label implementations?

<div className="not-prose mb-4 py-4 grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 lg:grid-cols-2">
  <div>
    <BadReactInputFocus />
  </div>

  <div>
    <label>
      <span className="mb-2 block">My Cool Input Label</span>
      <input className="p-2" placeholder="My cool input text" type="text"/>
    </label>
  </div>
</div>

It may not be obvious to the naked eye, but if you inspect the elements and poke
around at the code, you can see they are very different. One of them uses a
`div` with an `onClick` to focus the input, (which is something I actually saw
in a real code base!) while the other uses semantic HTML to wrap the input in a
`label`.

<CH.Code>
```jsx BadReactInputFocus.jsx
// from ./BadReactInputFocus.jsx
```

```html accessible-html-input.html
<label>
  <span class="mb-2 block">My Cool Input Label</span>
  <input class="p-2" placeholder="My cool input text" type="text" />
</label>
```

</CH.Code>

### What about these buttons? Are they the same?

<div className="not-prose mb-4 py-4 grid grid-cols-1 gap-8 lg:grid-cols-2">
  <div
    data-message="Yay, you clicked the button!"
    className="inline-block text-center rounded bg-gray-200 p-2 text-sm text-black transition-colors hover:bg-gray-300"
    onClick={(e) => {
      alert(e.currentTarget?.getAttribute('data-message'));
    }}
    tabIndex="0"
    role="button"
  >
    Click me!
  </div>

  <button
    data-message="Yay, you clicked the button!"
    className="inline-block rounded text-center bg-gray-200 p-2 text-sm text-black transition-colors hover:bg-gray-300"
    onClick={(e) => {
      alert(e.currentTarget?.getAttribute('data-message'));
    }}
  >
    Click me!
  </button>
</div>

You may have already guessed this, but these are definitely not the same. One of
them uses a `<div>` to create a fake button and the other uses a semantic
`<button>` element.

<CH.Code>
```html fake-buttons.html
<div
  data-message="Yay, you clicked the button!"
  class="rounded bg-gray-200 p-2 text-sm text-black transition-colors hover:bg-gray-300"
  onclick="(function(element) { alert(element.getAttribute('data-message')); })(this)"
  tabindex="0"
  role="button"
>
  Click me!
</div>
```

```html semantic-buttons.html
<button
  data-message="Yay, you clicked the button!"
  class="rounded bg-gray-200 p-2 text-sm text-black transition-colors hover:bg-gray-300"
  onclick="(function(element) { alert(element.getAttribute('data-message')); })(this)"
>
  Click me!
</button>
```

</CH.Code>

## Text Content

Text content may not seem as important as UI controls, after all, won't people
just be reading it the way you style it? Well, not necessarily. For people using
screen readers, bad semantics can lead to a very confusing experience. Not only
that, but your SEO will suffer if you are not using things like headings to call
out what is important on your page.

### Which of these examples is using correct semantic markup?

<div class="not-prose grid gap-4 lg:grid-cols-2">
  <div>
    <h4>Example 1</h4>
    <BadTextSemantics />
   
  </div>

  <div>
    <h4>Example 2</h4>
    <GoodTextSemantics />
  </div>
</div>

<CH.Code>
```jsx BadTextSemantics.jsx
// from ./BadTextSemantics.jsx
```

```jsx GoodTextSemantics.jsx
// from ./GoodTextSemantics.jsx
```

</CH.Code>

## Wrap-up

This only scratches the surface of the true impact semantic HTML makes on the
usability of your site for your users. As the web evolves, we are only going to
have more and more ways to interact with it, so thoughtfully using semantic HTML
is going to be the best way to ensure you are providing the best experience for
_all_ users on _all_ devices.
