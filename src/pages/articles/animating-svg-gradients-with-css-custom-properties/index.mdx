import { ArticleLayout } from '@/components/ArticleLayout';

export const meta = frontmatter;

export default (props) => <ArticleLayout meta={meta} {...props} />;

## Changing SVG colors is easy right?

I certainly thought it should be and in the past it has not been too difficult,
with things like changing the `stroke` or `fill` of the SVG on hover, but what
about when we want to hover a solid colored SVG icon and have it change to a
gradient? This proved to be much more difficult and led me down several
different paths trying to get it to work.

## Table of Contents

## Setting `stroke` and `fill` on hover

My first naive attempt was to treat the gradient like any other color and try to
set `stroke` and `fill` to the gradient on hover.

```html stroke-fill-svg.html
<!-- TODO -->
```

## Using `<linearGradient>` in the SVG code

After the naive approach did not work, I did some research and found a
[Stack Overflow Post]() that recommended using `<linearGradient>` directly in
the SVG code and applying it as the `stroke` and `fill` on hover.

```html linear-gradient-svg.html
<!-- TODO -->
```

This ultimately did work, but it seemed to be impossible to use transitions to
have the colors gradually change, which led to a less than desirable jarring
color swap.

## Using `@property` for the gradient colors

After almost deciding to settle and just accept that I would not be able to fade
the colors in and out nicely, I stumbled upon
[this post](https://dev.to/afif/we-can-finally-animate-css-gradient-kdk) which
inspired the solution utilizing CSS custom properties.

```html css-custom-properties-svg.html
<!-- TODO -->
```

## Wrapping up

TODO Is there a better way to do this that I didn't try? Hit me up on Twitter
and let me know! [@RobbieTheWagner](https://twitter.com/RobbieTheWagner).
