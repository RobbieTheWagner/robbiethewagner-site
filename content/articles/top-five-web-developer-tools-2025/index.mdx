## What are the best tools for web developers in 2025?

I did a post on this a couple years ago laying out my
[top developer tools for 2023](https://robbiethewagner.dev/articles/top-five-web-developer-tools),
and I wanted to circle back and give a couple updates. Honestly, not a lot has
changed since then, but enough has that I thought it warranted posting about.

Let's jump right into it, here are my top devloper tools for 2025:

## 1. [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/)

Warp used to tout itself as "The terminal for the 21st century", but they have
blown right past that and are now shipping 22nd century level features. Warp has
quickly become my number one tool I could not develop without.

Starting with the basic features, which are already game changing, Warp has
reimagined how your output is displayed. Instead of a huge wall of text, your
commands and their output are grouped into blocks. This allows you to easily
navigate through them, and share them with your team for easier debugging. Warp
also has great autocomplete and remembers commands you have run previously.

    alt="Screenshot of Warp showing a command that was run and its output colocated in one block."
  />
</a>

Moving on to the even more impressive features, Warp has squeezed every last
ounce of goodness out of its AI integrations. You can use natural language to
search for commands and ask Warp's AI how to use them. Never again will you ask
"what was that command again?".

  />
</a>

Where Warp really shines is when you collaborate with your team. How many times
have your onboarding docs been outdated or spread across a bunch of different
files with outdated setup steps that usually don't work? Warp Drive has
notebooks that allow you to combine code blocks and documentation in one place
that lives next to your command line and syncs in real-time.

</a>

If you are looking for the best terminal to use today, look no further. Warp is
the gold standard and is just getting better and better.

## 2. [VSCode Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/)

<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/">

    alt="Screenshot of VSCode Insiders editing this very blog post!"
  />
</a>

These days it is almost required to use VSCode or something based on VSCode if
you want to be a web developer. There are just too many VSCode plugins you would
lose access to that would put you at a significant disadvantage if you used
something else. This was the case for me and when the Ember community, and all
of the Ember specific plugins moved to VSCode, I did as well.

Awhile back I decided to make the jump to VSCode Insiders. For the most part,
they are not that different, but the insiders version has a new version daily
and allows you to try all the cool new things that haven't quite made it to
VSCode stable yet.

If you do not have restrictions on what AI tools you can use, you may also want
to check out [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) which is based on VSCode and adds
a lot of AI goodness on top of it.

## 3. [Arc](https://thebrowser.company/)

<a href="https://thebrowser.company/">
  <Image

    alt="Screenshot of Arc showing GitHub open, some tabs on the left and a favorites bar"
  />
</a>

Arc is a really cool browser that has really changed the game and pushed the
boundaries of what a browser can do. In a sea of identical Chromium clones, Arc
really rose above the rest with their thoughtful and innovative feature set.

I still think one of the best features of Arc is their reimagination of tabs.
Moving the tabs to the left side, introducing spaces to organize them, and
defaulting to auto closing them is a game changer for tab hoarders like me.

Arc also has great keyboard support, with a command palette-like interface when
you press `CMD + T`. This maps to your existing muscle memory of opening a new
tab, but allows you to perform multiple different actions, instead of just
opening a tab.

  />
</a>

Since my original post, Arc has added a ton of stuff, unsurprisingly leveraging
AI to the max. You can now use Perplexity as your search engine, see summaries
of pages before navigating to them, and get a beefed up `CMD + F` command to ask
questions in addition to finding text.

There are many other features and quality-of-life improvements baked into Arc,
so give it a try for yourself and see what you think!

## 4. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

<a href="https://desktop.github.com/">
  <Image
    src={githubDesktop}
    alt="Screenshot of GitHub Desktop showing history and file changes"
  />
</a>

GitHub Desktop continues to be my go-to tool for quickly pushing code, opening
pull requests, and interacting with GitHub repos in general. It is certainly not
the flashiest or the most feature rich of the git GUIs that exist, but it is the
most straightforward to use and gets out of your way so you can just ship code.

One of my favorite things is having a button to open a new pull request from my
branch. It takes out the unnecessary step of needing to push, then open GitHub
and create a PR. It seems like a small thing, but I find it incredibly useful.

    alt="Screenshot of GitHub Desktop showing the create pull request button"
  />
</a>

If you don't find joy in super complex GUIs or learning the ins and outs of all
the manual git CLI commands, you should really give GitHub Desktop a shot. Trust
me, you'll like it.

## 5. [Kaleidoscope](https://kaleidoscope.app/)

<a href="https://kaleidoscope.app/">
  <Image

    alt="Screenshot of Kaleidoscope showing a diff of two versions of a file and combining them into one merged file."
  />
</a>

I don't always use a diff tool, but when I do, I use Kaleidoscope. I have found
most other diff and merge tools to be too complex and require a deep
understanding of how git works just to use them. This has trolled me many times
and I have lost work I meant to keep.

Kaleidoscope keeps it simple, and has a beautiful user interface that makes
resolving conflicts a breeze. It allows you to view what changed over a time
period, compare branches, and comb through the entire history of your files.

I have not even begun to scratch the surface of all the features Kaleidoscope
has, but I still think it is worth it just for the basic diff and merge
functionality. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed!

## Wrap-up

In my opinion, these are the top 5 web developer tools you should be checking
out in 2025 to streamline your workflow. Did your favorite developer tool make
the list? If there is something cool you think I missed, let me know on Twitter
